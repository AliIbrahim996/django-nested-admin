Documentation
=============

django-nested-admin is a project that makes it possible to nest
admin inlines (that is, to define inlines on InlineModelAdmin classes). It
also allows these inlines to be sorted by drag-and-drop, and has optional
Grappelli support.

Compatibility
=============

django-nested-admin is compatible with Django 1.8+ and Python versions 2.7 and 3.4+.
It is also compatible with Grappelli and Django Suit. It does not require Grappelli
or Django Suit for the drag-and-drop sorting features.
